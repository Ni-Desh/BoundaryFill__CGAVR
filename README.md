# BoundaryFill__CGAVR
This C++ OpenGL program implements the 8-connected boundary fill algorithm for region coloring using mouse input. You can easily switch to 4-connected fill by commenting out the diagonal recursive calls (clearly marked in the code). Useful for computer graphics assignments and learning flood-fill techniques.
